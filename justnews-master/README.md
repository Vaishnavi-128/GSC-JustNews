  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>SheRights is a React Native application designed to help women stay safe and empowered. The app contains various categories such as Domestic Violence, Education, Reproductive Health, Forced Marriage, Workplace Discrimination, and Sexual Assault. Each category, after clicking on it, is surveyed with 7-option-based questions where each option selected has a score, and at the end of the survey, the total score is calculated for 7 questions, and the severity of the case is displayed to the victim.</p>
